Parser to  convert microsattelite data

Genepop format parser is a toolkit that converts files to popular microsatelites data formats. It can be use to convert genepop data to arlequin, linkdos and fstat formats and vice versa. It is useful to make population statistics in files from many other programs.
It is a useful tool that allows you to make analysis offered in the module popgene, on data formats from another type of tools. The program has 4 methods of getting data from various formats to
relevant elements, and 4 methods of saving data to the same formats, what also makes it usefull when popgene data would be used for analysis in other popular biostatistics programs.

How to use:
After program starts, the user is asked to declare input data format ( if that is earlier than Python 3.0 version, names should be written in quotation marks ) and required output data format. Then user should give the name of the input and output file.
